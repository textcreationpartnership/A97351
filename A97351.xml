            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T ſuch time as the flowers appearing vpon the earth, had ſummoned the ayrie quiriſters to entertaine the firſt Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Spring, and that Nature (deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine wombe of Winter) had ſhewed her ſelfe lyuelie as the morning, faire as the nightes Gouerneſſe, pure as the Sunne, and as almighty as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of inuincible fortune: The vnhappy and forlorne Shepheard <hi>Credulo</hi> being come to the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Tagetus,</hi> from whoſe large diſtributed skirts, ranne an euen and wel leuiled plaine, through which the ſiluer-flowing <hi>Erimanthus</hi> had made many curious and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable windinges, till ſhe deliuered the abundance of her tribute into the boſome of the Ocea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnruly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie: and being arryued at the vtmoſt of the earths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte, he encountred with his companion (both in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and deſires) the forſaken <hi>Carino,</hi> whoſe eyes (long
<pb facs="tcp:178497:4"/> before that time drown'd in their owne teares) were now ouer earlie awaked to bathe them-ſelues in the tearye ſea of others more deere afflictions: And being mette in that alone lonelineſſe (which extreameſt of all miſeries had choſen out as a plat-forme whereon to build that day a ſtage for an immortal Tragedie) they ſate downe, &amp; caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eies vpon the waues (whoſe vaſt ſolitarines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their mindes the liuely <hi>Idaeas</hi> of their vnaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied lamentations) began bitterly to complaine, that hauing ouer-laden hearts, broke &amp; deuided with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints (which by inceſſant bemoanings they ſought ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werly to disburden) fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d neither eaſe nor reſpet, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more augmentation of their continuall child-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring miſchiefes: where-upon <hi>Credulo</hi> commenting in the ſadneſſe of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, more large volumes of griefe then his weake tongue could deliuer, thus ſpake:</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Carino</hi> (ſaid he) hither are we come to behold not the laſt act (though as bleedingly pitious as the lateſt can be) of Infortunes worſt Tragedie, preſented to the ſtony eyes of creatures inſenſible, becauſe barbarous: and acted by the greateſt Beautie that euer before this day aroſe in the skie of anie womans countenance: Alas that miſerie ſhould be ſo Imperious, as to dare to take poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Pallace of Vertue; or vertue ſo fearfull, as for any diſaſter in-fortune, to forgoe the habitation of Beautie: Will the Almightie Iuſtice in his Diuine prouidence create excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t frames to ignoble vſes? or Nature ſpend the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treaſure of her workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip, in a receptacle for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt imperfections?

How oft haue thou and I (my <hi>Carino</hi>) from the top of yon Mountaine ſent our eyes with the imbaſſage of our heartes, conueying in blood-drawing ſighes, (ſpeedy meſsengers of diſpaire) the occurrents of our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes? How oft vpon this Plaine haue wee in darke <hi>Eglogues</hi> diſcourſed the pure intent of our honeſt ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? How oft vpon theſe Sandes haue wee wrtten her name with our Sheep-hookes, which the iealous Sea in loue with, hath greedily ſnacht into his boſome?

Haue we at any time deſiſted from the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our firſt paſsion? Hath there euer been ſeen cooleneſſe in the burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of our deſires? Haue our mindes ſlept at all in the ſhade of a reputed obliuion? Or hath the Hiſtorie of her praiſes at any time found an end in our ſpeaches? the

O <hi>Cinthia, Cinthia,</hi> our Fieldes Garland, our Winters ſpring, our Sommets ſhade, our Harueſts fruit, and the liuing cauſe of all Creatures happy liuings be thine eyes the witneſſes of our vowes, and our owne deedes the teſt monies of our faithes: be thine admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as great as our loues, for our loues ſhalbe as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les as the infinite world of thy perfections: Continue the miracle of time, as thou art the wonder amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt women; that when Enuy after this day ſhall boaſt Queene <hi>Hellen</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> was vertue, yet thy vertue ſucceeding all ages, may ſtill ingraft (in remembrance) an induring and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blotted excellence.</p>
            <p>Heere an extreame violence to ſpeake much in the praiſes of deuine <hi>Cinthia</hi> (whom with equall ardor they both moſt ſincerely adored) ouer came the power of much ſpeaking, and with dumbe Oratorie conuerted his language to dumbneſſe; whilſt <hi>Carino</hi> thus replied.</p>
            <p>What needes (my <hi>Credulo</hi> ſaid he) this inditement againſt the hope of our contentment, whoſe deſperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution long ſince hath pleaded guiltie before the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt iudge of our Fortunes? To reckon our cares, were to number the ſtarres: to meaſure our loues, were to make a circle greater then the greateſt either is or can bee: and to vnlade our affectionate deſires, were by ſpoonfulls to conuay the Sea into ſome contrary Channell: what they are we feele, and when they ſhall determine, the all-ſeeing all-thinges only hath knowledge: as eaſie can the Sunne be remooued from his diurnall paſſage, as our thoughts from her remembrance, or our hearts from the loue of her vertues: Haue not we ſucceeded both in our loues and admirations, the truely louing <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius</hi> whoſe induring conſtancies, &amp; forlorne indurances, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:178497:5"/> their <hi>Vrania</hi> beyond the degree of ſuperlatiue? And is there likelyhood we will either ſeeke the abridgement of our woes (which is the badge of our ſufferance) or the end of our loue (which is the heauen of our cogitations) no, no my <hi>Credulo,</hi> it was Vertue that brought foorth wonder, wonder knowledge, knowledge loue, and loue the eternitie of our neuer to be ſlaine affection: Be then the world by vs fil'd full of the praiſes of deuine <hi>Cinthia,</hi> and euery Mothers child taught to adore the Starre can lead to ſo heauenly perfections. But whether are we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the force of her remembrance, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our owne duties? aroſe wee thus early for this? came we to complaine to the Ocean for this? wette we our vn-dride cheekes with new teares for this? or are our moanes ſenceleſſe to all be moanings but this only? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as euery place is for orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beholding to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; ſo is this ſubiect indebted to euery place for a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relenting, and inticing acceptance.

This fight continued in the viewe of the Sheapheards by the ſpace of two howres, with no leſſe terrour to them (who arm'd with ſo ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a diſtance as might giue aſſurance from any aſſaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had notwithſtanding through their eyes receiued the wound of feare vpon their hearts) then repentant ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in thoſe that vnder-went the reuenge of ſo haughty courages: But by and by they ſawe the Ships which till then had as it were kiſt one an other, &amp; hung togither by an vnfriendly &amp; boyſtrous imbracement, diſſeuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; the Gally, what with the force of her Oares, and a little helpe of a quarter winde which breath'd vpon her Sayles, made her way directly foorth into the Sea, with ſuch eagerneſſe of ſpeede, as many times we ſee a Pirate when he hath in chaſe a rich and well laden home-retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Marchant; but contrary to that, the Gallyoon with al the canuaſſe ſhe could put forth, boare before the wind as euen vpon the ſhoare as might be imagined, yet might they ſtill beholde (as long as the vertue of their ſightes could hold the knowledge of any obiect) one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted Champions in the Gally, not onely continue, but in more mortall and deſperate manner; continue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable

But euen at the laſt pinch, when ſtrength had as it were finiſhed the need of ſtrength, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly ſtrength forſooke him, and he ſunke downe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any longer to preſerue that life, which ſtill then had preſerued the life and eſtate of many kingdomes: but the guilty waters (aſhamed to bee guiltie of ſo execrable a murther) opened their boſoms, &amp; brought him vp again into the aire, where by the force of the ſiege of the Sea he was borne vpon the ſands, and lay to the iudgement of the Shepheards (who till then vpon their knees, were

As ſoone as ſhe had ſet her foote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore, which was no ſooner then the coffin could be diſcharged of the Barge, there might ſhe ſee vpon the ſands, <hi>Leander</hi> drowned, and <hi>Hero</hi> lamenting ouer him, in her Nunne-like and virgin-ſtained apparell; who with all the impoſsible paſsions of an impoſsible to be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed furie, acted with ſuch liuely tremor, the worſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſse of a decayed fortune: that <hi>Hellen</hi> ſtood as much amazed to behold her, as grieued to ſee ſo much woe in a counterfeyt diſcontentment; and in her amazement looked firſt vpon <hi>Hero,</hi> then vpon her ſelfe; after vpon <hi>Leander,</hi> laſtly vpon <hi>Amphyalus,</hi> and thus many times ſent her lookes to and fro poaſting without intermiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euery looke bringing her backe matter of more mourning; in the ende bowing downe her heauenly countenance, ſhe ſaid, if there were an end in woe, it were nothing to be woe begone: but being eternall, it is a ſadde Dietie; and with that paſsed forward on vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her iourney. But ſhe was not gone halfe a league fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the ſands, ere ſhe ſawe a Nymph running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, whoſe haires being looſed, partly by the winds, but chiefly by the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of her tyrannous white hands, followed after her in ſuch a diſpearſed length, that if at any time ſhe ſtoode ſtill, they ſeemed to kiſse the baſe earth in the falling, or couer it in the golden riches of their beautie; as if ſhe would make that barraine mould
<pb facs="tcp:178497:18"/> to be eſteemed before any other element; her necke was naked, only a coſtly Rebat of flowers, (halfe looſe) hung fallingly vppon her ſhoulders; her garments which were of a Sea-coloured ſilke, curiouſly embrodered with a Minataurian Laborinth, were in many places torne, but ſo as euerie eye might ſee the diſgrace was begot more through a wilfull madneſſe, then eyther a negligent careleſneſſe, or a wantfull needineſſe; thus as ſhee ranne, ſhee ſometimes threwe her armes from her, as if ſhe would beat away the winds that flew wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly about her; ſometimes drew them backe, and lockt them in togither, as if ſhe woulde imbrace or hold the ayre from fleeting; and ſometimes linking her Iuorie fingers one within another, raiſe them aboue her heade to the Sky-ward, as if with that geſture ſhee would call pittie from the heauens. And with theſe paſsionate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons filled the eies of her beholders, till come within the compaſſe of their eares hearing, they might more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand her dolours, which with a burden of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſighes made euermore their concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the name of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> accuſing him of flintie hardneſſe in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting; of vnkindneſſe in not louing; of tyrannie, in not pittying; of falſhoode in diſſembling; and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratenes in iuſt deſerts vnrewarding. By this the Queen perceyued it was forſaken <hi>Aryadne,</hi> left to the worlde by vniuſt <hi>Theſeus,</hi> in the memorie of whoſe miſhaps (as in an excellent myrror) ſhe ſaw the liuely image of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; wherevpon ſhe ſtaid with wonder, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with pitie at that which in her-ſelfe ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pittie nor wonder at: and as ſhe ſtoode in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed pauſe with teare-filled eyes, ſhee ſawe olde <hi>Sylenus</hi> vppon his lazie Aſse, eyther in a dead ſleepines,

After all theſe came the youthfull God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> drawne by foure ſnow-white Harts, and two ſauadge Boros, in a Vinetree chariot, couered &amp; invecked with cluſters of ripe grapes, and faire ſmelling flowers.

            <p>
               <hi>Hellen</hi> being now com'd almoſt within the view of the cittie <hi>Phalautus,</hi> mounted vpon a moſt faire Neapolitan Courſer, &amp; accompanied with an hundred knights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Eſquires, and baſer attendants, in a moſt ſolemne and ſtately maner, met her vpon the way; and hauing (when ſhe had leſſe cauſe to make much of melancholy) made tryall of her reſolution in miſerie, omitted all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ceremonious perſwaſions, and onely gaue her that intertainment which ſtoode moſt agreeable with her diſtemperature, adding teares to teares, ſighes to ſighes, and out-cries to lamentations hauing learned all this Phyloſophie, that to ſooth Melancholy, is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Melancholy, and not to contradict the humor, is to giue it knowledge of the errour in the humor. After him came all the Magiſtrates and chiefe Burgers of the citie, whoſe low lookes and vnpleaſant geſtures, gaue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that where the beſt part is diſeaſed, there the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſeruing members muſt of neceſsitie pine in a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing weakneſſe. And thus they marched in a ſad trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantneſſe, like an ore-comming hoſt, that vanquiſhing many, by the loſſe of one particular, is notwithſtanding ſubiect to a ſubdued heauineſſe. Now when ſhee was com'd to the port of the Citie, and was readie to enter in, ſhe was there met with all the Damzels and virgins thereof, who attyred Nymph-like in looſe ſilkes, which the breath of eue ie ayre wantonly carried, and moued about them, with baskets of Roſes, and the moſt choyſe

And as the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins paſsed thus along, ſome with Timbrils, ſome with Kyttes and ſome other newe inuented Inſtruments, to which they accorded the heauie accents of their moſt ſorrowfull voyces, they ſang this mournfull and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giacke paſsion:</p>

            <p>After many thankes (interrupted with many teares) both to <hi>Phalantus</hi> for his care of her, and to the reſt, for the ſufferance of her follie, through which ſhe gat the knowledge of their loues: ſhe with the dying <hi>Amphyalus,</hi> betwixt whom and death was almoſt ſealed the deed of perpetuitie, with-drew her ſelfe, and was no more ſeene in publique, ſo the ſpace of fortie dayes: during all which time, ſhee bequeathed the deſperate caſe of her loues Lord, into the hands of the skilful Phyſition: A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch age &amp; decrepidneſſe, that euen his life acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a loathſomneſſe in her habitation, and Nature whome the hande of Arte by mending regenerated, with a malicious enuie languiſhed her continuance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bettered by that which for her ſlaue ſhe created. He was by birth an Arabian, and well trayned in the vſe of letters, whoſe neare alliance with the Sun inſpiring him with a ſpritie humor of ambitious knowledge, led him to delight in trauell, and the taſte of vnexperienced cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes; to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vpon a day to the mount <hi>Ida,</hi> he met with a Nymph belonging to the fount <hi>Gaballine</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being inquiſitiue to know the maners of that place, he got the knowledge of the learned. Wel of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mules, and the court of memorie yet vnſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and wandring further, hee came into the groue, where <hi>Paris</hi> firſt wooed <hi>Oenon,</hi> ſaw where they pitched their toyles, where they made their Pitte-falles,
<pb facs="tcp:178497:21"/> where in the heate they lay and mocked the Sun which could not warme them; and in the coole where they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, while the Sunne with his gentleſt heate, did refreſh them; and amongeſt many reliques left there for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of their loue, hee found that heauenly and rare Booke, which <hi>Apollo</hi> when he was ouer-gone with affection and deſire of her beautie, gaue her as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eternize her name before many multitudes of admirable women: in it was the portratute of all hearbs, plants, Mynerals, or what euer belonges to the ſacred ſtudie of Phyſicke, together with their vertues, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, effects, and vſes: this he tooke, for this <hi>Oenon</hi> had careleſly caſt away, when confounded with the burden of care, ſhe was become an out-caſt in the worlde, and forlorne of <hi>Paris.</hi> And hence came thoſe vncurable cures, which in the opinions of men made his name with ſuch vnſpeakable reuerence adored; and this ſtill he practiſed vpon the wounded <hi>Amphyalus,</hi> with ſuch proſperous ſeruiceablenes, that in few dayes he brought backe vnto him life, and his ſeruant remembrance; who yet not peace with that life which with former vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he had violently put forward to deſtruction, began afreſh to gall him with newe thoughts of that auntient Diſdaine, wherewith the moſt excellent <hi>Phyloclea</hi> had disfigured and ouerthrowne the beautie of his fortune; ſo that the inuiſible wound of his ſoule, tankled and kept open the Vlcer of his bodie; his newe life being an olde death worſe then the bodie and the breathles diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which once perceyued by this moſt learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſcience, he immediately applyed thoſe Antidots to his vnderſtanding, which drowned all the faculties of his mind in a Lethe of forgetfulneſſe; and he became

And now for exchange, both his reaſon, iudgement, and affections, as the Actuaries or ſetters downe of his wils Cronicle preſented vnto him, all the perfections and vertues of the truely louing <hi>Hellen.</hi> Now he ſaw in her beautie, which onely beautifying it ſelfe, beautified all things that to it ſelfe was adioyned: An eye that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with many tongues of delight, ſpake onely with the tongue of true affection; A brow wherein dwelling all the Maieſties of diuine greatneſſe, yet onely ruling with one which was the moſt humbleſt wiſdome.

            <p>To this he made anſwere, that as concerning his birth (which he couetted to conceale in the boſom of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) hee was borne in <hi>Iberia,</hi> and though vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet Prince and heyre of that Dominion, his name was <hi>Adunatus,</hi> the bitterneſſe of whoſe fortune bore in it ſuch tragicke matter of a life fore-worne, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the moſt vnſpeakableſt miſerie that euer abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute miſer could intitle miſerable; as hee did not onely grieue, but feared to diſcouer to the worlde the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his woes, which (as he was perſwaded) went far beyond either compariſon, or coniecture of the woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt eſtate whatſoeuer; and therefore moſt humblie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her, that hee might no further reueale the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe of his miſhaps, whoſe vntunefulneſſe would but diſtaſte the noble eare of her vnderſtanding; laſtly, for his aduenture thither, hee ſaid it was a bleſſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and a happy ſhipwracke, becauſe he hoped that her excellencie (of whoſe wrongs euen Gods &amp; Angels ſtood agreeued) ſhould from the hand of his danger reap the new inioyment of her abſolute ſafetie, and therefore that ſhe ſhould not need to command his ſeruice, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudy how to imploy his ſeruice, which all be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy matter more precious then the deareneſſe of his life

            <p>This princely legacie (ſaid ſhe) is a royall inrichment to the loweſt deſcent of Fortune: But O this worlds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, this courſeſhip of words, this father accomplime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, this honie aire, this bond of breath, this coppi hold right of friendſhip, is no other then the ſhadowes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which then at all is not when wee moſt aſſuredly imagine it is, and I feare mee this bequeſt will bee but as the Teſtament of a liuing man, which is apt to change with the change of euerie opinion.</p>

            <p>At that worde the whole aſſemblie, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite clamour ſtopt the further paſſage of her wordes, and flocking about her like a ſwarme of Sommer Bees, on the Mount of <hi>Hybla,</hi> cryed, ſhe had but well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that there was nothing but iuſtice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all ſhee had ſpoken; turning all the raſors of their opinions agaynſt that iudgement, for whoſe maintenance before they were onelye whetted; ſo variable are the reſolutions of the multitude, and ſo apt to delight in the laſt ſound, how diſcordante ſoeuer.

            <p>Howe ſutable to your Noble grauities is this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conſent (moſt famous Laconians) who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that is worthie of any knowledge, &amp; how much in my ſelfe it ſhall be both reſpected and rewarded, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe mine hereafter deſeignes, and my preſent thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for neuer was there anie example of more iuſt loue, or of the loue of iuſtice; yet ſith delay is the onely torrent of hope, and Deſire the ſworne enimie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that mine innocent ſute may be ſtained with neither of their imputations, beholde here the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince of <hi>Iberia,</hi> the famous <hi>Adunatus,</hi> who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expoſe his ſacred perſon in ſo notable a defence, ſtandeth to approoue her neuer to-be blotted innoceny.</p>
            <p>Scarce had the Queene deliuered theſe wordes, when <hi>Coſmos</hi> againe ſtept forth, <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Diſdaine</hi> warring in his countenance, willing to defende what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defencible, began to ſeconde his firſt ſpeech; But the common people, according to their common cuſtome, when either they heare what they woulde not, or are come to the full poynt of what they expected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſome to hemme, ſome to cough, ſome to ſpit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a <hi>Babell</hi> of confuſed vtterances, that neither were his wordes reteyned, or reſpected; which percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Adunatus,</hi> who preſsing forwarde with his horſe, as a ſignall of ſomewhat hee had to ſay, the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly were calmed, and hee lifting vp his Beuer, thus ſpake.</p>
            <p>Fire (my noble Lords) is neuer quencht with ſwords; nor wel grounded reſolutions altred with weak perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; then why go you about by aire to alter that which
<pb facs="tcp:178497:33"/> euen by the deſtinies I perſwade my ſelfe is foredoom'd and decreed; the offer is noble and not to be refuſed, the reaſons ſtrong and not to bee refelled, and my ſelfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, neither by any other aduenture whatſoeuer to bee withdrawn or concealed; for a ſeal to which noble deed I beſeech you all, my Lords, remember and publiſh this my proteſtation. Firſt, I proteſt this hapleſſe Queene to be vertuous, immaculate and innocent, of all her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde husbands imputations: and ſith ſhe hath no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer but his iealouſie, euen to that iealouſie, and that tongue which hath beene the Herauld to that iealouſie, I heare denounce the lie, &amp; will with this conſtant hand guided with my reſolued heart, be readie to defend the ſame againſt <hi>Amphialus,</hi> the world, or by whom ſo euer I ſhall be called.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner made this proteſtation, but the people gaue a great ſhowte, and the Nobilitie ſeeing how this deluge had drowned all their former reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with vnwilling willingneſſe gaue conſent to the motion, decreeing the execution ſhould be deferred, and meſſengers diſpatched through all the forraigne parts of Chriſtendome, to giue notice to <hi>Amphyalus,</hi> of all that had paſſed in their proceedings: but <hi>Euronuſa</hi> loath to leaue <hi>Hellen</hi> in the hands of her executioners, fearing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hate of age might worke hurt for policie; or the flatterie of youth might faile in a diſtreſſed fortune, ſhee humbly he ſought the Lords of <hi>Laconia,</hi> that they would deliuer vnto her the vnhappie Queene, whom by the vowes of her princely worde, and all the obligations which could tie ſo great an Empreſſe, ſhee ſolemnely ſwore to bring forth vnto them again vpon fortie dayes warning, whenſoeuer they ſhould commaund, for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:178497:33"/> tryall and hazard of her fortune.</p>
            <p>The Nobilitie, as willing a little to flatter <hi>Hellen,</hi> whoſe beſt fortunes were not altogether confounded, as loath by her detaining to giue larger limits to her hatred, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Queenes requeſts, &amp; accepting her prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde for her redeliuerie, in moſt humble manner gaue the wofull <hi>Hellen</hi> to the noble <hi>Euronuſa's</hi> protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, excuſing much of that inexcuſable courſe, which with ſuch wilfulneſſe they had purſued. Now was the meeting of theſe two Queenes full of paſsion &amp; delight: Paſsion in their woes, Delight in the excellencie of their woes: but after a little enterchange of ſorrow (which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour though of ſome it be helde baſe and coward; yet of others it is eſteemed the ornament of Age, Vertue, and Continence) they hauing in their embracements and kiſſes, told the tongue-tied meſſage of their herts, began now in ſolemne ſort to take their leaues of the Lords and States of <hi>Laconia;</hi> the wofull Queene <hi>Hellen,</hi> in her ſilence, ſhewing that ſhe deſired nothing which themſelues did not firſt deſire. But <hi>Phalantus</hi> humbly crauing her to meaſure his doings by the power he had to doe, and not to let his ſilence condemne what his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thoughts were in labour to bring to paſſe, beſought both the Queenes to accept his ſeruice, and that they would vouchſafe him leaue, to attend them into the Ile <hi>Tenedos.</hi> The Queenes right gratefully accepted his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and ſo after many acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliments twixt him and the worthie <hi>Adunatus,</hi> they departed on vpon their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, where hauing paſt through the Countrey of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> without any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worthie noting, they came at length to thoſe ſands which lie agaynſt the Ile <hi>Cythera,</hi> from whence by an
<pb facs="tcp:178497:34"/> euen line they may paſſe to <hi>Tenedos;</hi> there they found at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the Queene <hi>Euronuſa</hi> ſixe Gallies, which had formerly waſted her ouer; into which ſo ſoone as the Queenes were readie to enter, the moſt excellent <hi>Adunatus,</hi> with a countenance as full of Maieſtie as loue, (yet neuer any countenance more dearly beloued) humbly beſought the Queenes that hee might attende them no further in that iourney, but that like an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated carkas, or a ſoul-leſſe man (for other he proteſted he was not) he might ſpend ſome few dayes in the queſt of his friend, whoſe abſence was vnto him the abſence of all comfort whatſoeuer, which friend (he ſaind) hee had loſt by ſhipwracke immediately before his incounter with the Queene <hi>Euronuſa;</hi> to this intreatie he adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſolemne oath, and an inuiolable proteſtation, once euer in forty dayes to giue notice to the Queenes, where, or in what place hee remained, that whenſoeuer he ſhould bee called, eyther by <hi>Amphyalus,</hi> or any other, hee woulde bee prepared to giue an account, both for his owne, and the deſolate Queenes fortune.</p>
            <p>The Queenes greeued at his deſire, yet were loath to grieue at anie thing hee ſhould deſire, loath in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to countermaund any his demaundes, yet wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing a power to commaund his demaundings, with teares in their eyes (the true meſſengers of their loues) and humbleneſſe in their lookes (perfite badges of their obedience) they anſwered him, that ſince in his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues was the felicitie of their liues, and that as leſſer Spheares they were onely moued by the power of his greatneſſe, it became them not eyther to queſtion or contradict, onely this they beſought him to imagine, that his preſence was vnto them as the Sunnes faire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:178497:34"/> beames to the ſtorme-wrackt Mariner, and his abſence like the hower of indurance in the houſe of affliction; but ſith his content muſt be begot by their diſcontents, they were willing to bee pleaſed with their greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.</p>
            <p>Thus after innumerable teares ſhed, and many hearty departures, the Queene hauing appointed her choyſeſt Galley to attend the Prince in his iourney, giuing him ſundry moſt rich iewels for the teſtimonies of her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they went all aboord, the two Queenes, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus,</hi> directing their iourney for <hi>Tenedos</hi> the Prince <hi>Adunatus</hi> holding his courſe for <hi>Cythera,</hi> and the lower Ilands, but there he found nothing but that hee would not haue found, a certain abſence of his friends preſence: thence he returned backe into Greece, to ſee if at the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympian</hi> games he were preſent; but the ſports were to him weariſome, or not at al becauſe <hi>Thaumaſtus</hi> was not there at all: from the <hi>Olympian</hi> games, hee went to the games <hi>Pithii</hi> (celebrated in the honor of <hi>Apollo</hi>) but fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them lonely, becauſe without his friendes companie, from thence to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and to the ſtrait of <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> to ſee if at the games <hi>Iſthumi,</hi> (founded by <hi>Theſeus</hi> in the honor of <hi>Neptune,</hi>) his friend might bee found; but no place yeelding him the comfort of his friend, he grew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe in himſelfe. Thence hee went to the games <hi>Nemei;</hi> thence in Creete, to ſee if at <hi>Pirrhus</hi> daunce hee were preſent: but finding euerie place as ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as him-ſelfe was hopeleſſe, hee directed his way-vp into <hi>Theſsalia,</hi> where hauing trauailed ſome fewe dayes, hee came to the skirts of the Mountaine <hi>Oſsa,</hi> whoſe well-raiſed Brow ſeemed to be a counſell-keeper with the Firmament, and whoſe well proportioned
<pb facs="tcp:178497:35"/> hugeneſſe, and well apparelled beauty, teſtified the great diety of our firſt grandame Nature. Keeping his way by this mountaine, he arriued at the head of the riuer <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus,</hi> whoſe ſmooth delicacie, and delicate ſmoothneſſe, did forcibly inuite the eye of the traueller, to wonder at the ſmoothneſſe. Here the Princes horſe finding his maiſters care, careleſſe of his labour, began to tyre, and with a ſuddaine ſtop taught him to know, that violence is without continuance: whereupon the Prince aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his backe, and plucking off his Bridle, gaue him leaue to feede vpon the choyſeſt graſſe, whileſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withdrawing himſelfe into a goodly wood of Pine-trees neare adioyning, where thinking to make the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſleepe a comfort to ouer buſie care, hee began to lay himſelfe down vnder the Canopie of a goodly Pine, but a little keeping his eyes open, that they might after cloſe with more ſafetie, he might beholde hard by him a thicke, darke, and moſt obſcure groaue, where bramble, Thorne, and Brier, had with ſo many interlacings and interchangeable windings, knit &amp; co-vnited their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together, that the all-pearcing Sunne had not power to dart his ſmalleſt beames through the wydeſt Caſement; at this the Prince a little amazedly looking, thinking that Nature ſhould not beſtow ſo great Arte vpon ſo baſe matter, he might behold (though halfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured with the leſſer trees) a little Arch, which men might imagine a doore, yet ſuch a doore as would ſcarſe giue entrance to a Pigmy without ſtooping, ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut through the middes of the thicket, that it gaue the eye a little more liberall paſſage into the bowels of that night-like darkeneſſe. The Prince wondring at his imaginations, which preſented him with nothing but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:178497:35"/> imaginarie wonders might at laſt perceiue come cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon his hands and knees through that little Arch a moſt decreeped and aged old man, who with the help of his Crutch (the onely companion of his weakeneſſe) rayſing himſelfe from the ground, he diſcouered the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monument of Nature, Time, and mans weakneſſe; his bald-head circled with a few milk-white haires, and his long gray beard girdling his withered cheekes, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked like the flakes of ſnow vppon the Alpes, or Pyrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: his hollow eyes hid in red cabarets, neuer weary of weeping for their youthes wantonneſſe, looked like two decayed Lampes, whoſe Oyle was conſumed; next his skin he wore haire-cloath for repentance, and vpon it a gray gowne for warmth, which maintaining life, made more large his repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance. At his girdle his Beads, in his hand a Book, whoſe leaues were worne with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turning, and ſullied with the teares of his true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Thus being come forth to ſucke vp the ayre of this wholeſome place, ſitting downe vpon a neighbour banke vnto the groue, and lifting his eyes to heauen, the Prince might heare him deliuer theſe or ſuche like ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>O Ambition, thou neighbour vnto Kings, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with greatnes; why doſt thou bewitch vs with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, yet giueſt the firſt taſte of ſolitarineſſe? why ſeekeſt thou to be alone, yet vſurpeſt on many kingdomes?

But whilſt in the gloriouſneſſe of this eternall glory, ſhee trac'd about the banke of the fountaine, viewing her face in the chriſtall water; mee thought I ſawe a bluſh like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning breake from the skye of her countenance, and ſhe ſmil'd to ſee how the beautye of her face ſtaynd all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beautyes with which ſhe was adorned, whereby ſhe appear'd to ſay thus within her ſelfe; Alas I ſticke not theſe flowers about me to adorne my beauty, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace their owne glories, when euery creature ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde how exceedingly I exceede them; But ſee alas <hi>Siluagio</hi> whilſt thus my labouring imagination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented theſe delightes to my deſiring ſoule, the moſte excellent Princeſſe tourning about her fayre quicke eye (O eyes to whome all eyes are homagers) ſpyde the buſh to mooue wherein I was ſo ſafely coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereat as miſtruſting treaſon to her perſon, ſhee ſlung downe her flowers, and like the light windes which ſcorne to preſſe the graſſe in their motion, fledde from my preſence, beeing the lighteſt Nimph on foote that euer was behelde by eye or by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; And heere with a big-ſwelling ſigh, he ſtayed from further ſpeaking, till <hi>Siluagio</hi> a new reuiuing his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:178497:42"/> remembrance, deſired him to proceede and ſhowe what effectes ſprang from the cauſe of this enterviewe: This, this (quoth <hi>Thirſis</hi>) I inſtantlye felt a boyling Spring ariſe in my heart, which with a bubling mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, making his paſſage through euery Veine and Artery of my bodye, like the ſhallowe ſtreame which breakes his way through the pibble ſtones, incited mee with a new deſire to follow her, but being with-held by Obedience, I was content to perriſh with Loue, But (ſaid <hi>Siluagio</hi>) did you neuer ſee her ſince? yes, yes, (qd. <hi>Thirſis</hi>) in Damſon tyme when it pleaſed her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nymphes and Shepheards to gather the earely fruite of the Sommers rypening, ſhe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to mounte vp into the Trees, and to ſhake the plumbes downe into her lappe: O how I did enuy the ſenceleſſe fruites happineſſe to ſee it fall and ſporte vpon that boſome, where euen Gods and Angels might haue beene proude to haue repoſed; yet did this fauour ſo inrich my fortune, and my ſeruiceableneſſe drawe on the fauour of further ſeruice, that when it pleaſed this Princeſſe (or rather Goddeſſe) at anye time for her delight to goe angle in the leſſer brookes, onelye I was commaunded to prouide the baytes, I onely had the charge of her hooke, of her line and her angle; how oft I kiſt the Cane, becauſe her hand in touching had kiſt it, how oft I imbraſte the lyne that had beene wantonlye intangled about her, how oft in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerye I ſtole the touch of her prettye fingers, Iudge Loue, Iudge Louers, iudge all that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. O God yet me thinkes I ſee with what delight the ſilly fiſh would glaunce at <hi>Melidoras</hi> beauty through the glaſsie ſtreame, whilſt deceiu'd with her bayte
<pb facs="tcp:178497:43"/> ſhe had ſtrooke them all with her hooke, onely the laſt nibled ſo long about the line, that when the Princeſſe thought to pull her pray to the ſhoare, the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hooke it ſelfe was taken quite away; at which ſight my paſsion quickning my blood, and my blood reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſpirrit of my wordes: I could not forbeare to ſay, behold thou all conquering Empreſſe of mens hearts, the glorious blaze which this angling beautye layes to catch mens ſoules, ſhall euen in this manner bee gnawne and taken away by the Yron teeth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming tyme; and where ſhall then be the future power of killing? yet louely Maide tryumph ouer me, whome you haue already taken, euen mee that like this ſimple frye delight in my periſhing, and if you doe (as your fayre eyes are witneſſes) bemone the fiſh which hath ſwallowed downe your hooke, whoſe lingring tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſigne of certaine death; then pittye me your ſlaue, the merryt of whoſe affection ſhall farre exceed the compaſsion due to any vnreaſonable creature. And what (ſaide <hi>Siluagio</hi>) did the Princeſſe anſwere to this pretty gloze? Sparkes of diſpleaſure (ſayde <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>) flew with ſuch a diſdaine from her eyes, that I was euen <hi>Phaeton</hi>-like thunder-ſtrooke from the Charriot of mine ambition, whilſt caſting her louely countenance to the humble earth, and knocking her ſiluer chinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Iuorye boſome, with a ſilence that ſpake as much as could be vnderſtood by Anger, threwe downe her angle, &amp; departed from my preſence, her departure telling mee that the ending of her ſportes ſhould bee the continuance of mine affliction;</p>
            <p>Canſt thou not (ſaid <hi>Siluagio</hi>) by neglecting her, faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion thine eye to finde ſome other object? How ſhall I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:178497:43"/> finde other (anſwered hee) and in her haue loſt my ſelfe? By forgetting her remembrance (ſayde <hi>Silua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio.</hi>) Shee is my remembrance (anſwered <hi>Thirſis</hi>) and will not bee forgotte whilſt I retayne my memorye. Then ſue againe (ſayde <hi>Siluagio</hi>) thy teares may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torte ſome pittye; I dare not (cryde <hi>Thirſis</hi>) leaſt I offend her patience: Why tell mee (ſayde <hi>Siluagio</hi>) what if ſhee were within this Forreſt begyrt with Tygers, Lyons, or with Sauage Beaſtes? I durſt (quoth <hi>Thirſis</hi>) attempt her in ſuch a caſe, becauſe it were a reſcue for the pretious Iewell of her life; What (ſayde <hi>Siluagio</hi>) if thou ſawſt her taken by Theeues, by Satyrs, or by wilde Sauadges? Why (quoth <hi>Thirſis</hi>) I durſt charge an Armye to relieue her honour: What Rocke ſo ſteepe that for her ſake I would not climbe? What Flood ſo deepe that for her I would not ſounde? What flame would I not indure? What froſt would I not ſuffer? nay, what Hell would I not ranſacke with <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſo that the end of my labour might but bring my loue within the looke of entertainement? Beleeue mee (ſaid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagio</hi>) ſhee were Flynt it ſelfe, if ſhee heard thee, and did not yeelde thee the fauour of her countenance: but come, aryſe my <hi>Thirſis,</hi> and caſt off this ſorrow being no attrybute to Vertue, but rather the Tytle of malignitye, beeing euer an hurtfull fooliſh quality, full of baſe thoughts and cowardize. Ariſe I ſay, and as wee walke along, I will (if thou pleaſe) to kill thy paſsion, ſhow thee the errors of thy paſsion: or if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thy taſte cannot indure ſuch bitterneſſe, I will to flatter thy Loue, ſpeake much in Loues commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: well (ſayde <hi>Thirſis</hi>) ſince thy knowledge is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:178497:44"/> well able to declaime of euerie facultie in our pſsions, I am content both to attende thee, and lend thee mine attention, ſo that in thy diſcourſe thou exceed not the limits of modeſtie, by ſpeaking againſt loue, (to whom I am a ſlaue,) nor againſt beautie (to whoſe perfections I am an eternall inthralled pryſoner.) And with that <hi>Thirſis</hi> ariſing from the ground, walked along with <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagio,</hi> hoping ere long to finde ſome occaſion which might occaſion him to retyre to his former ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and in their walking, <hi>Siluagio</hi> began thus to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him.</p>
            <p>Of all the excellent humors, wherewith the minde of man doth commerce, or find it ſelfe buſied (my <hi>Thirſis</hi>) there is none either more hot, more ſharpe, or more full of prayſe-worthie action, then this of loue: which howe euer more colder capacities ſhall intitle Ague-like vncertaine obſeruing fittes and times, without eyther modeſt ſtayedneſſe, or conſtant perſeuerance, yet in the well ſetled iudgement of the vertuous, it is found a generall fame of an equall compoſure, conſtant, and firme, ſmooth and ſweete, not raiſing deſires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Moone, nor purſuing <hi>Tantalus</hi> fruit, which flyeth vs in following, neither doth it when willes are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and married togither (as men ſuppoſe) mourne and conſume, as if ending in enioying, but enioyeth according to the excellencie of the deſire that holds it, retayning a ſpirituall reſidence in a minde made pure with long vſe and cuſtome, excelling all other affections and paſsions of the minde, like a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent picture that is bordered about with Antike Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage, or Crotesko works of ſlight eſtimation. This loue is not the moſt fruitleſſeſt and baſe of all Paſsions, as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:178497:44"/> being begot by <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Sloath,</hi> as working vppon weake hearts and frenzies, as onely accompanying mutinous paſsions, and diſcomfortable ielouſies; and in the ende aſpyreth to a minutes Delight, which is vſherd with much paine, and followed by an eternall future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: No, no, my <hi>Thirſis,</hi> true loue, and true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe mingle and confound themſelues ſo in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a generall mixture, that they out-weare and looſe the port or gate of their firſt entrance, <hi>Reaſon</hi> being taken away, and a more excellent and more fatall power made Miſtreſſe of that neuer to be vntied vnion: theſe paſsions which they feigne to be his conſorts, are ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the minde, which enuying loues exquiſiteneſſe, ſeeke with their poyſons to confound his beauties, but in the ende, like cloudes betwixt the Sunne and our eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, doe but darken loue, that when loue breakes out, it may be more reſplendant.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Siluagio</hi> was thus going on, and diſcourſing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing loue with diſprayſes, <hi>Thirſis</hi> whoſe minde was buſyed about much higher thoughts, woulde ſuffer his eares to retayne nothing, ſaue onelye the ſounde of his ſpeeches, till in the ende lifting vppe their heades, they might eſpie the onely Paragon of this worldes knowledge the excellent <hi>Melidora,</hi> ſomewhat a farre off, comming in the ſelfe ſame path in which them-ſelues walked, in ſo much that except they retyred, they muſt perforce meete her eye to eye, and viſage to viſage. Shee was Nymph-like cloathed in ſundrie coloured ſilkes, which being placed one vppon another were of an equall diſtance, one ſhorter then another, the in-moſt being longeſt, as brauing of his moſt inwarde and familiar acquaintance, yet all
<pb facs="tcp:178497:45"/> of them ioyning their beautyes together, made round about her an arteficiall Rayne-bowe, her hayre beeing wound vp in a lace of golde, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with manye Flowers; all which beauties as if they had beene too glorious for heauen, or to rich for earth, were ſhadowed and all ouer-caſt with a large vaile of white Cypreſſe.</p>
            <p>In this ſorte ſhee was returning from the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> that day beeing the great Saboath dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Goddeſse, whereby the auncient ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and edictes of that place, all the Nimphes are to make their perſonall appearance, and to offer ſolemne ſacrifice, and other priuate ceremonyes to the Queene of Chaſtitye, beeing all vaylde from the iudyciall cenſure of the eye-ſight, leaſt the miſpriſion of a bluſh, or the attaindure of a pale looke ſhoulde giue occaſion to a wanton thought to miſdeeme innocence,</p>
            <p>In this Temple vppon this day, if there bee found therein or after knowledge bring to light that there might haue beene found therein anye man or creature of the Male kinde, it is preſent death without appeale or iuſtification. In this ſorte like the glorious Sunne in his noone-tyde progreſſe, came ſhe tracing along the vallyes, her pretty foote ſcarce preſsing downe the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that it troade vppon. But <hi>Thirſis</hi> eyes, which long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had taken a full draught of her beautie, being now lightning, ſtrooke with the beames of her preſence, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power to retire, his ſoule being retired from al pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand his intendments; amazedly ſtood ſtil with fixte eyes, ſwolne heart, ſad thoughts, ſtiffe ioyntes, and all the terrors that could accompanye Loue in his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:178497:45"/> deſperate eſtate; till <hi>Siluagio</hi> whoſe vnrefined ſpirit did more wonder then retaine the remembrance of what he wondered at, awakning <hi>Thirſis</hi> intranced ſoule, with earneſt perſwaſions, deſired him once more to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Goddeſſe of his fortunes, alledging that ſtale hope which is euer moſt hopleſſe; that ſhe was a woman and there was no impoſsibilities. But <hi>Thirſis</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once ſeene <hi>Diſdaine,</hi> carried euer after his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in his boſome, like an affrighted child, that hides his head when the nurſe talkes of a Bugge-beare, would faine haue gone aſide from his ſorrow, telling <hi>Siluagio</hi> it was but labour loſt, ſith both her greatneſſe, vertue, and chaſt thoughts, were in this conflict his mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But <hi>Siluagio,</hi> taking vpon him the power of <hi>Reaſon</hi> to ouerthrow <hi>Paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> with a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly vpbraiding of <hi>Thirſis</hi> timerouſneſſe, by no meanes would be withſtoode, but would force perforce, enforce him to meete the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſaying: who dares not aduenture, can neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; neither he which will not hazard vpon peril, ſhall haue the honour of perils ouerthrow; therefore aduance thy falne thoughts (my <hi>Thirſis</hi>) and pleade their humble ſeruiceableneſſe whileſt I with-drawe my ſelfe into this groaue, and pray for thy ſucceding fortunes. At this <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagio</hi> withdrawing himſelfe apart, yet not ſo farre but that his eares might haue part of their conference, the noble Princeſſe keeping her direct courſe, and being come euen almoſt to the place where the loue-thralld Shepheard ſtoode, the poore Swaine moſt humbly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon his knees, gaue her this ſalutation.</p>
            <p>For euer may the graſſe be greene (moſt ſacred Nimph) which thou treadeſt vpon, with thy more dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie feet, and may an eternall Spring flouriſh in thy walks,
<pb facs="tcp:178497:46"/> as thine immortall Beautie flouriſheth in the hearts and eyes of all thy beholders.</p>
            <p>To this ſalute, the Princeſſe in a prettie ſilent bluſh, giuing him a ſleight thanks, offered to paſſe by him, as carried away with farre greater deſeignes then the note of his fauours. But the forlorne Shepheard, who before fearing to offend, nowe hauing giuen offence, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iniurie and it to haue both but one merite, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nymph by her ſacred garments, &amp; binding his knees ſtill Apprentices to the baſe earth, thus ſeconded his former ſpeech, after many teares and ſighes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
            <p>Thou onely Superlatiue of all thy ſexe, euen for thy vertues ſake flie not from thy ſeruants preſence, but if it be poſsible that the deſperate anguiſh of my loue, may raiſe any appearance of pittie in the all-ſauing Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy ſweete, chaſte, and ſober countenacne, euen for the honour of thine owne deare name, vnto which all the hearts of Kinges are tributarie, ſende forth ſome ſparke to lighten my darke ſoule. O ſhunne me not I ſay, alas t'is for the harmeleſſe Lambe to ſhunne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring Woolfe; you are too fearefull (Ladie) O you are farre too timerous, I am your ſeruant, your vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and the worke of your owne eyes making; alas I come not to offer viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but to receiue outrage. Deare Goddeſſe, emptie thy Quiuer, ſpend thy Shafts vppon my ſoule, O ſticke them vp to the feathers in my heart, for well I remember thou diddeſt long ſince giue mee that incurable wound, which corſiue like eating my heart, hath confounded my ſoule; and Reaſon leauing nothing but thy pittie to call me from eternall bondage. O thou immortall mirror where beautie findes out her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:178497:46"/> beſt beauties, thou that art the kingly ſeat of triumphant loue, daine that thy faire eyes which make the morning bluſh, which parch heauen, ſcorch earth, fire the woods, breakes the froſt, flowers the earth, and turnes the darke night to the comfortable day, O let thoſe eyes which are ſo much the fayrer, by how much my torment is made greater by them to pittie the anguiſh I haue got by gazing on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melidora</hi> with a bluſhing countenance, whoſe ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie colour gaue a ſigne of heauenly anger, eyeing the Shepheard with an appauling Maieſtie, demaunded of him if hee were not that <hi>Thirſis,</hi> who comming but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into theſe walks, had made thoſe curious hookes and baites with which her-ſelfe and the other Nymphes had ſo oft taken ſo manie fiſh? He made her anſwere, it was hee: ſhee demaunded againe, if it were not he that had made the curious Nets, wherewith himſelfe and the Shepheards had taken ſo manie birdes? hee made her anſwere, it was hee; why then ſaid <hi>Melidora,</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard farewell, I will no longer ſtay with thee, leſt I bee likewiſe taken by thee; but hee ſtaying her againe, ſaid; Excellent Ladie, how can you be made captiue by your priſoner, or howe can your ſubiect alter anye of your determinations; alas (moſt excellent creature) you know my ſeruice hath attended you in the woods, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, on the Mountains, at the ſprings, at the riuers by day, by night, I at euery ſilent time, and yet hath my thoughts bin pure without the ſtaine of villanie: I ſaide <hi>Melidora,</hi> but when yong deſires begin to ſting and bee inflamed, you giue me cauſe to fear the effects of frenzie. I hope (ſaid <hi>Thirſis</hi>) by that to purchaſe my glorie, when you beholding mine anguiſh, ſhall admire my patience;
<pb facs="tcp:178497:47"/> O but you may forget your ſelfe (ſaid <hi>Melidora</hi>) Ile near forget (ſaid <hi>Thirſis</hi>) to doe that which ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent you; Ile neare attempt that which in my knowledge ſhal offend you. I take you at your worde (ſaide <hi>Melidora</hi>) hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I charge you that you forget to loue me; for there is nothing in the world can bring my minde better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; againe I charge you, that you tarrie no longer in my preſence, for nothing in the worlde is more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue vnto me. Madam (ſaide <hi>Thirſis</hi>) both your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds are extreame; yet to the firſt I muſt needs make anſwere, I can neuer forget to loue you, becauſe all my thoughtes doe (and muſt euer ſo doe) liue in you. Why (ſaid <hi>Melidora</hi>) will you loue mee in deſpight of me? O no (ſaid <hi>Thirſis</hi>) not in deſpight, though I cannot retyre; Well (ſaid <hi>Melidora</hi>) if thy diſpoſition be as full of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, as thy words are of care, auoyde from mee, or let me goe from thee; I hope (ſaid <hi>Thirſis</hi>) that <hi>Time,</hi> who is the worlds conquerour, will eyther conquer you, or conſume me, I humbly take my leaue. And with that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ground in ſuch an heauie perplexitie, that ſorrow was neuer to bee ſeene in a more ſorrowfull ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, he departed from her; and went, not reſpecting where or whither, onely deſirous to hide his heade in ſome dark Caue, where none but Miſerie and he might liue togither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Siluagio</hi> that ſawe him thus depart like a condemned man; and was a witneſſe of the heauie ſentence that ſhee his cruel Iudge had pronounced, wondring that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall furie ſhould be found in a heauenly bodie, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nature that had placed a flintie heart in a ſilken Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, followed his friend with infinite penſiueneſſe, as well to preuent the aduauntage <hi>Diſpaire,</hi> might take of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:178497:47"/> griefe, as to fortifie that wounded hope which now was euen at his laſt breathing. But <hi>Melidora,</hi> all-be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of her owne diſpoſition, could haue affoorded a more milder repulſe, yet at this time her mind being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with ſuch an earneſt affection, as may well be comprehended within the title of loue, would not ſuffer her tongue to deliuer any other ſatisfaction. And this was the reaſon:</p>
            <p>There is a gallant yong Shepheard, who ſome three yeares agone, hauing ſeated himſelfe in <hi>Tempe,</hi> hath ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there with much happineſſe, more admiration, but moſt loue, his beautie inticing his good diſpoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, and his vertue binding vnto him, all thoſe with whom at any time he conuerſed: His rurall profeſsion was beautified with a Cittie-gouernment; his homely attyre had a courtly faſhion, and his plaineſt diſcourſes were interlyned with wittie and morrall conſtructions: his words were queint, his behauiour ciuill, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires lofty, inſomuch that he was called the courtly ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or the noble Paſtor, exceeding all his fellowe-Shepheards, excepting onely the moſt rare <hi>Thirſis,</hi> whom he could exceede in nothing but in the bliſſe of affection.</p>
            <p>This worthie Swaine had long time before <hi>Thirſis</hi> came into theſe parts with his noble deſeignes, which promiſed more then could be comprehended in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey fortune; had ſo won the heart of the excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Melidora,</hi> that ſhee did not diſdaine to call him her ſeruant, and with many graces did ſo adorne his bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that his loftie fortunes might well contend with any Monarchs greatneſſe, in-ſo-much that loue, who had euer liued priſoner in her eyes, began to dart his
<pb facs="tcp:178497:48"/> beames into the Shepheards heart, and with a wanton recoyling, to looke nowe and then downe into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, making his dayly ſeruice the witneſſe of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured loue; and her Fauour an Herauld to pronounce that by poſsibilitie ſhee might loue. Nowe it happened that this day beeing the great Sabboth of <hi>Diana,</hi> the Princeſſe had promiſed her Shepheard <hi>Diataſſan</hi> (for ſo was he named) after the Rites and Ceremonies were finiſhed, to meete him in a moſt pleaſant Arbor, ſeated in a delicate groaue, dedicated to the Goddeſſe <hi>Chloris,</hi> to which none but her ſelfe onely had priuate acceſſe, there to diſcourſe vnto him the order, the pompe, and the manner of the Ceremonies, which were due to the greate Goddeſſe, and to that ende ſhe was walkt foorth as before I haue rehearſed: and beeing nowe entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arbor, finding her Shepheard not come, taking vp a Lute which lay ypon a bed of flowers hard by, to whoſe ſweete ſound coupling her more ſweeter voyce, ſhe ſang this Sonnet.</p>

            <p>She had ſcarce made an ende of her ſong, before the courtly Shepheard <hi>Diataſſan</hi> entred into the groaue, bluſhing to ſee his abſence condemned of all negligent errors by her preſence, humbly beſought her Maieſtie to pardon his ſlow-footed attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, alledging the care of his folde, the feare of ſuſpect, and many other prettie excuſes: but aboue all, he alledged the loſſe of a moſt dainty lambe, which he had moſt curiouſly brought vp, and wherewith <hi>Melidora</hi> was much delighted to play, ſaying that morning, the cruel wolfe had ſtolne it away, in-ſo-much that hee purſuing the chaſe, tooke the wolfe at his pray, and then had no remedie but to kill him that had killed her play-fellow. <hi>Melidora</hi> ſmiling, made him anſwer, that if ſhe had not ſome conſtant trials of his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, ſhe ſhould feare leſt ſome violent miſchance would eyther kill, or take him from her ſeruice; but hee whoſe feruent loue could induce no colde ſuſpition to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie his apoſtacie with more then an vſuall earneſtneſſe, beſought her not to make doubt of his faithfulnes, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Heauen, by Earth, by Loue, by the golden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his hopes, by all his comforts paſt, &amp; by all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to come, and laſtly by her ſacred ſelf, who was the great volume which contained the cronicle of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that no time, no chance, no change, nor no admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhould take from his name the title of her eternall Admirer, wiſhing ruine to his bodie, infamie to his name, and immortall death to his ſoule, when his pure thoughts ſhoulde bee blotted with the ſtaine of diſloyaltie; and with that kiſsing her hande,
<pb facs="tcp:178497:49"/> and ſhedding ſome teares thereon, deſired her not to ſuſpect him till ſhe was inwardly reſolued, abſolutely to kill him; which ſhe promiſing to performe, they ſate downe togither vpon a flowrie banke within the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whileſt <hi>Diataſsan</hi> calling to remembrance her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſe, humbly beſought her to tell him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Dianas</hi> ceremonies, what was the pompe, the ſhow, and the order of their ſacrifice: to which ſhee thus anſwered. To tell thee (my Shepheard) at length with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out omiſsion, all the ſtately proceedings due this day to our great Goddeſſe, neither could a Sommers day, nor Winters night, out-laſt my diſcourſings: wherefore we will omit it till a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient time for ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; onely one accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as worthie note as loue it ſelfe is worthy memorie, which fell out this day in the Temple, I will impart vnto thee, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the Nymphs and Mayds, which this day made the Altars of the great <hi>Diana</hi> ſmoake with perfumed Sacrifice, I ſpyde a virgin, who beſtirring her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a buſie toyling Bee, exceeded many of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts in praying, in ſenſing, in ſacrificing, and in ſinging: by her geſtures I could not ſuſpect her knowledge, her garments I knew not, her face becauſe of her vaile I ſaw not, and for her ſpeech like the reſt, it witneſſed vnto me that ſhe was a ſtranger. After her ſacrifices were aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; ſhe for her more diuinne contemplation, retyred into a priuate ſeate, my ſelfe cloſely ſtealing from the reſt of the Maydens, came and deuoutly ioyn'd me to her ſide, where I had not long ſeated my ſelfe, but I might perceiue ſhe caſt many pretty gazes vpon mee, ſuch as by the interpretation of affection are ſaid to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie loue in their glaunces; at firſt I wondred, but at laſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178497:49"/> I encountred her looke for looke, making loue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent linguiſt onely by demonſtration; and all-be the race was but ſhort, yet was there a large field for loue to tylt in betwixt each of our gazings; my face being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all ouer with this vaile, had onely two loop-holes left for mine eyes to looke through, From whence (ſayd this Nymph) ſhe ſaw ſuch heauenly glimpſes iſſue, as matcht the Sunne, which ſtraitned betwixt two clouds, darts into the worlde faire louely beames of induring brightneſſe; I tolde her, if in me there were any of thoſe glories, they onely were borrowed from her, and from her beautie: with that ſhe whiſpering in mine eare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded my name? but I wringing her ſoftly by the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hande (and to make my ſelfe ſome prettie ſport by this inſtant accident) tolde her that I was a Shepheard, not a Nymph, and that onely for her ſake I had diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelfe, fearing not the daunger of my life, becauſe I had none but by her ſufferance, meaning in this Temple and at this holy time, to conſecrate my chaſte thoughts to her ſeruice. She againe demaunded of me my name, and I anſwered her it was <hi>Diataſſan;</hi> And I pray you Ladie (ſaid <hi>Diataſſan</hi>) what anſwered ſhee to that name? Vpon the knowledge of that name (ſayd <hi>Melidora</hi>) wee concluded, that this night when the Nymphs doe come to fetch water at <hi>Mineruaes</hi> ſpring, ſhee ſhall come the hindmoſt in the traine, and that I wayting for her in a mazie Thicke adioyning, ſhall as ſoone as I perceiue the Nymphes to returne home, diſcouer my ſelfe to her, who fayning odde tryfles to ſtay behind them, woulde adminiſter vnto me al aduau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Much other talk we had, but in the end when the rites were ended, ſhe ſighing departed; my ſmyles ready to

And as they were thus diſcourſing, a Page belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto the Princeſſe, came into the Arbor &amp; brought her worde that al the Forreſters were attending her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie at the Lodge, to knowe in what parte of the forreſt ſhe intended the next day to hunt, that orderly prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be made for her ſportes? with that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe aryſing with ſuch a geſture as did enuye the times ſwiftnes, ſhe tolde her ſhepheard ſhe muſt be gone, but he deſiring leaue to attend her, ſhee earneſtly forbad him, ſaying the tutret loue is the cottage hate, and ſo ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, onely accompained with her Page to her owne Caſtell.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as the Princeſſe was gone, <hi>Diataſsan</hi> reuoluing in his minde vpon the aduenture ſhe reported, grew into an amazed extaſie, <hi>Deſire</hi> &amp; <hi>Wonder</hi> breeding in his ſoule a thouſand Chymeras and ſtrange imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; one while feare appald him, leaſt dooing iniurye to the Princeſſe, he might kill his loue and Fauour: then preſently <hi>Deſire</hi> inflames him to beholde her whoſe loue liuing vpon his name is derided by fortune.

            <p>After they had ſung this ſong, euery one dipping her golden Flagon in the Fountaine, after ſome little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſpeech, wherein one gaue prayſes to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Minerua,</hi> another commended the vertues of the water, and others the ordinances of thoſe Ceremonies: In the ſelfe-ſame comely order as they came, they nowe began to returne. But <hi>Diataſſan,</hi> who during all the time of their abode, had with a curious eye behelde the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Nymph of the traine, began to reade within the faire ſtorie of her beauties, many remembrances of thoſe ancient thoughts, which had long agoe (in the Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of his firſt loue) infinitely ſurpriſed him. Manye tymes, his eyes tolde him they ſawe nothing but that ſight which they had moſt dearely loued. His thoughts tolde him they were inriched with no new cogitations, and his heart affirmed, that but that Image there was none in it perfectly engrauen; to be plaine, ſhee ſo much reſembled a worthy Nymph, whom in his firſt youth he had loued moſt ſincerely, till iniurious Death had made a diuorce betwixt their affections, that euen now his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting eyes began coward-like to yeeld to the aſſault of her beautie: and not content to yeeld alone, did ſo perſwade his heart, that hee couetous of new honour, ſubiected all that was in him to her obedience; <hi>Melidora</hi> was now in his minde but like that picture which <hi>Zuxis</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:178497:51"/> deſired to ſee vnder the painted ſheete, which was mear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing, as hauing no place or being all that he was, was but onely a ſcrole of this new affection: And now beholding <hi>Apheleia,</hi> both with ſlowe pace, and ſome ſleight excuſe loiter behind the reſt of her felow nimphs, he diſcouered him-ſelfe, and with a gentle pace ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking her, after his downe-caſt lookes, and ſome trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling wordes, had like a preface tolde her, his talke muſt be all of loue; taking vp her hande, and giuing it a loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſſe, he demaunded of her if that hande were not the hand which did prodigally caſt into his fruitfull breaſt the faire ſeed of blooming fancie, whoſe ripe harueſt ſhal returne her milions of gaines; or tell me faire Nymph (ſaid he) are not theſe glorious eies of yours, the war-like Cytadels where all conquering loue ſits as in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire cloathed with the rich ſpoyles of many kingly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes, and for a tryumph hangs out his moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colours? O God they are; &amp; therefore let neuer any Shepheard feare <hi>Ioues</hi> thunder-bolts, or in their Carols aduance the vnconquered ſword of the God of warre, but let them all bee amazed with thy beautie, and with that amazement let them record the victories thou haſt obtained of the worlde, of loue, and of me thy ſeruant. Wel I remember that in the April of my yeares, I haue been ſomtimes inticed amongſt my fellow Shepheards, to taſte the delights of youths inuentions, and in thoſe delights haue delighted to approue the mindes of many Maidens, yet neuer till now haue fixt my conſtant mind of any; till I ſaw thee I ſaw not any that coulde content me, for whoſe ſake I haue this day deſperately aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured my life by comming diſguiſed into <hi>Dianas</hi> temple, wherefore (deare Nymph) let the former words which

To this ſhe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered; Faire She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard, according to mine agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, here I make good my promiſe, yet not in ſuch ſorte that by it thou ſhalt ſuppoſe I ſtande intangled in thoſe fooliſh ſnares which you <hi>Theſſalians</hi> call loue: but for it pleaſed thee (without eyther <hi>Deſire</hi> in me, or <hi>Deſert</hi> in my perfections) to make ſo franke and abſolute a gift, of thy hart, of thy ſoule, and of thy ſelfe, to reſt euer at my diſpoſing, ſo that it ſhould be vtterly vnlawfull for any but me to giue, to retaine, to keep, to change, or to diſpoſe any thing within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of thine affection, and that al thy thoughts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould maiden-like giue a modeſt and ſincere at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance vpon my will, which ſith I ſee thou doſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually performe by this newe ſeconds of thy former loue, be thou pleaſed with mine acknowledgment, that I haue heard thy loue: O but (ſaid he) ſhall the tender of theſe my ſeruices receyue at thy hands no recompence? t'is recompence inough (ſaid ſhe) that I giue credit to thy words, &amp; accepta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thy ſeruice. Why then (ſayd he) let this bondage of my loue bee like thoſe calme blaſtes which kindle the fire of delight, whoſe flame breaking forth into the world, may make vs admyred of all conſtant beholders.

To which

And here the Monſter began to folde his armes about her Iuorie bodie, from which ſhe nimbly deliuering herſelfe, fell downe vppon her knees like a deuoute Saint, praying to a damnable Idoll, and humblie beſought him to take away her life, rather then to attaint her honour; in which mercifull proceeding he ſhould bind her ſpotleſſe ſoule to do him ſeruice in a better kingdome; O excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man (ſaid ſhe) let me not ſuruiue my happineſſe; make me not wretched by a weary life; but ſith the vttermoſt of reuenge is but death, let my death at thy hands make

Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Demagoras</hi> ſaw the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard comming to aſſaile him, he left the Princeſſe, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:178497:58"/> taking vp a maſſy club of Steele, which euer be boare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with him, he met the ſhepheard, thinking with one blow both to puniſh his pride for daring; and to finiſh the combat which he ſcorned to account a contention. But the Shepheard as nimble in his deliuer action, as he was valient and powerful in deſtributing blowes, at the firſt encounter with a ſlip auoided the downefall of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magoras</hi> ſtroake; &amp; in the ſame inſtant making good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his former ground, gaue <hi>Demagoras</hi> ſuch a blowe vpon the ſhoulder, that it made his arme ſloathful in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing his club to reuenge the paine he ſuffered; But wrath &amp; diſdaine, or a diſainfull wrath, that hee ſhould meete with an incounterour, madding his ſoule, cauſed him ſtrike at the Shepheard with ſuch furye, that had it light vpon, eyther his head or body, it had vtterlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all the reſt of his members, but as the former, ſo he did, auoided the ſecond, retourning backe ſuch heauy intereſt, that <hi>Demagoras</hi> was ſometimes ready to ſincke vnder the burthen. Thus betwixt them began a fearefull and dreadfull combatte, the noiſe of their fierce blowes awaking the Princeſſe from her ſwound, whoſe eies being opened to ſee the amorus ſhepheard thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged for her ſake, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ouerflow their bankes with new teares, not teares of griefe for her bondage, but that her deliuery ſhold be more yrkſome then the baſeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude. The valie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhepheards rare valor, his Prince-like cariage, &amp; his infinite daunger, wrought but this in her minde, that ſo her honour might bee vnſtained, ſhe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſht death then this likely deliuerance, as hating that life, which to him ſhe could not affect, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be ingadged. Whilſt thus with theſe thoughtes ſhe was variouſly carried, wiſhing health to the Shepheard,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:178497:58"/> whoſe health ſhe onely confounded; the fight more and more augmented, &amp; <hi>Thirſis</hi> had with his hooke drawne much blood from <hi>Demagoras,</hi> which to reuenge, <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garas</hi> bringing all his forces into his armes, hee ſtroke at <hi>Thirſis</hi> ſuch a counterblowe, that a little glauncing vpon his head, put him into a little ſtamering amaze: which perceiued by <hi>Demagoras</hi> and much doubting by former proofe the requitall of ſuch payment; taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of that ſtroake, turned his backe and ran with all his power into the thickeſt woodes where curſing and banning both the heauens and his fortunes, he hid himſelfe from the view of all creatures. After <hi>Thirſis</hi> had in his purſuite both loſt the ſight of his enemye, and the hope of his reuenge, he returned back to the Princeſſe, whom when he found in that manner bound like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſacrifice vpon a prophane Altar, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon his knees before her &amp; ſaid. Goddeſſe of my life, pardon I beſeech thee, my preſumption in that mine vnworthy hands dare be ſo bould as to touch the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treſſes of thy goulden hayre: alas it is thine own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the cruell knots knit by the moſte hatefulleſt hand that euer prophan'd holy relique, which compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me to looſe them, muſt excuſe mine arogance, And with that vntying her faire hayre, and ſetting her at new libertie, with a greedy eye, that was neuer ſatisfyed with looking, he gazed ſo earneſtly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, that in the end i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining her eye did chide his eye, for his ouer curyous wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, turning his face away, he thus ſaid vnto himſelf.</p>
            <p>O Gods whilſt <hi>Diſdaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Rigor</hi> drew blacke cloudes of diſpayre betwixt the Princeſſe and mine affection, how mee thinkes the Sunne hath diſſolu'd them and made my Starre ſhine fayre vppon my miſſeyre:
<pb facs="tcp:178497:59"/> alas it may bee it is done but to this ende, that when I ſhall draw neare vnto the heauenly fire of her beautie, I may there conſuming ende my dayes with felicitie; how euer euen as the bird that is intangled in the ſnare of the fouler, doth at the laſt gaſpe take delight to heare that ſound which brought her to impriſonment, ſo doe her lookes (which brought this bitter anguiſh to my heart) not onely refreſh my ſenſes in their diſpairefull extremities, but comforteth my ſoule when ſhe is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to take her flight from my dying bodie. And whilſt he was thus talking in himſelfe, the Princeſſe (O that ſo faire ſhould haue ſo foule a fault founde in them) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thankes, without acknowledgement, or without leaue-taking, departed from his preſence, not ſo much fearing the daunger ſhee had ſo lately eſcaped, as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to auoid his preſence, whom ſith ſhee could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe could not acknowledge any bonde wherein ſhe ſtood indebted; which when the wofull Shepheard by his turning about perceiued, although he inquired of the Nymph <hi>Ethera</hi> (who then was as gratefull as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was cruell) whither the Goddeſſe of his fortunes was departed, hee coulde not chuſe but let the verie thought of her vnkindneſſe ſtrike him to the ſoule, with ſuch intollerable agonies, that although his ſighes, his ſobs, his teares, his broken heart, and his groaning ſpirit, were teſtimonies ſufficient of her too much ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, yet euen ſtriuing with life, he made his tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer theſe dolours.</p>
            <p>And is ſhe gone ſaid he? is there no curteſie, no ſpeech, no fauour, no thankes? O you immortall Gods, and thou great Nature that of nothing haue made this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall habitation, how negligent haue you beene in the

And euen as he was thus ſpeaking, hee ranne his head with all the ſtrength and power of his bodie ſo furiouſly againſt that tree, from which <hi>Melidora</hi> was but euen a little before looſed; that all be the hande of ſome ſupernall power (who no doubt in that hower reſerued him for farre greater happineſſe) did compell the blowe not to take that wiſhed effect the wofull Shepheard deſired, which was vtterly to haue finiſhed loue and life in a moment, yet had it ſo great efficacie, that it ſtrake him backewarde ſtone deade to all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>

The Nymph <hi>Ethera</hi> with a downe-caſt looke, and an humble reuerence, teaching her cheekes ſo artificiall a bluſh, as might verie well deceiue Nature, bowing herſelfe before the Princeſſe, and firſt crauing pardon for her bolde preſumption, in that ſhee had come ſo neare the place of her priuate retiring; aſſuring her with many prettie proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſhe was vtterly ignorant of her there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade: in the ende ſhee tolde the Princeſſe that for the ſong which ſhee had ſung, it was none of her owne inuention, but made by the famous Shepheard <hi>Diataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> in honour of the loue hee bare to the faire Nymph <hi>Apheleia,</hi> which ſhe of late hearing, had now newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to memorie.</p>
            <p>O God! had the Nymph <hi>Ethera</hi> out of an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable anger taken a vow vtterly to haue confounded the Princeſſe, or had the Princeſſe beene the vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all the generation from whence the Nymph was deſcended: had the Princeſſe beene her riuall in affection; the barre to her deſires; or had the Princeſſe ſaid, (what no woman can endure to haue ſaide) that ſhee had not beene faire, ſhee coulde neither haue founde a more readie poyſon, nor a more ſharpe reuenge, then the vtterance of theſe wordes, which ſhee deliuered: they were Daggers in the Princeſſe heart, they were woundes in her ſoule, and liuing deathes of dying liues anguiſh: what paſsion was there, with which ſhee did not communicate? what feare, what diſtruſt, what iealouſie, what madneſſe,

Alas poore <hi>Diataſſan,</hi> the vertue hath begot thee infinite enuie, and thine imaginarie happineſſe ſeekes to inrich thee with moſt cottaine miſchiefe, but thy goodneſſe hath taken ſuch well grounded roote in mine vnderſtanding, that nothing ſhall draw from thee the bliſſe of my good opinion: liue but as happie as thou art conſtant, and euen Angels ſhall finde want in thine vnbounded proſpetiue. And as ſhe ſpake theſe words, tears riſing in her eyes, as it were to make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the worlde which were the more purer Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, ſhe offered to depart.

            <p>I hearing this prettie ſute made from ſo excellent a mouth: tolde her, that all-be the liberall heauens had for their owne glories, and mans ſatisfaction created me a veſſell for their vſe, incloſing in mee ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their more ſecret wiſedome, yet that either my tongue ſhould raſhly breake vp the ſeales of the eternall regiſter of the vncontrolled Fates, or that my eaſie charitie ſhould for mortall ſatisfaction diſcloſe the counſailes of the ſtarrie Parliament, were both an odious blemiſh to mine olde age, and an vtter baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe graces, which by the grace of heauen had hitherto in me abounded; neither are (quoth I) the hie contemplations of the diuine powers within then reach
<pb facs="tcp:178497:72"/> of mans knowledge, being a creature rather created to looke into the wretched eſtate of his owne ſinfulneſſe, the remembrance whereof ſhoulde euen bowe our heades to our feete, and make vs with trembling ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration looke vpon thoſe dangers which howerly lie before vs, wherin we may behold in dayly models, how euen the wiſeſt doe fetter and intangle themſelues; yet faire Princeſſe, inaſmuch as I know your wiſdome is neuer vnaccompanied with <hi>Vertue,</hi> and that <hi>Vertue</hi> now inflamed with a deſire of vnreuealed knowledges; to giue ſome ſatisfaction both to your wiſedome, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and deſire, conſtantly behold this myrror or glaſſe of diuine prouidence. And with that I drew forth this glaſſe, which euer I beare in my boſome, in which as the Princeſſe gazed with a thirſtie eye, and an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med remembrance, ſhee might behold the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the round worlde, both heauen, earth, ſea, and hell; and aboue all as in a Spheare of the moſt ſpeedie motion, whoſe whirling ſwiftneſſe tooke from the eye the diſtinguiſhment of the matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was compoſed, ſhee might beholde ſet in her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphat Throne, the great and dreadfull Goddeſſe of Fortune incertaine <hi>Ramnuſia,</hi> who beeng ſet vppon three round <hi>Munddes,</hi> whoſe motions were three times ſwifter then the Sunnes Chariot, was at that time ſhaping all worldlye premotion into the faſhion of an almightie Wheele, running continuallye about an Axeltree wrought out of a rocke of impenetrable Diamond about this Wheele ſhee ſawe ſwarming all ſortes of people, euen from the Throne of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to the ſtoole of earth, which is much lower then the Cottage, ſome hanging by the heades,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:178497:72"/> ſome by the handes, and ſome by the feete, ſome by the eyes, ſome by the eares, and ſome by imagination: none hauing ſo certaine holde as coulde giue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to their abiding, nor anie one ſo incertainlye placed, as ſeemed to apprehende anie feare of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine falling; yet neuer did leaues in Autumne fall thicker from the parched trees, then theſe vaſſailes vnto Fortune, dropt and ſhewred downe from this infinite engine, onely one aboue all the reſt that ſat vpon the toppe of the Wheele in a Chaire of glaſſe, ſtayed and ſupported by many columbs and pillers of Chriſtall, Iette, and Porpherie, ſhewed that in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inconſtancie and exchange of alteration, there is euer ſome one figure of conſtant eternitie; this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon ſeemed to be the onely delight of Fortune, as in whom ſhe had planted her choyſeſt affections, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her the controll of her Godhead, and euen the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration downfall, and vp-riſing of her frownes, fauors and aduancements, this worthie creature the Princeſſe might ſee, with her hand lift vp, Millions to the toppe of Fortunes Wheele, and ſeat them with aſſurance round about her, ſhee might ſee her raiſe <hi>Gammede</hi> to heauen, and make him <hi>Ioues</hi> taſter, for whoſe take euen the whole generation of <hi>Troy</hi> receyued an eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſhee might ſee her take <hi>Appollo</hi> from <hi>Admetus</hi> flockes, to make him Lorde of the worlds beautie, and the Roman <hi>Maro</hi> from rubbing <hi>Auguſtus</hi> horſe, to ſing the honours, vertues and conqueſts, of the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall generations; what might ſhee not ſee hee doe that was impoſsible to be done by any other creature; ſhe might ſee her fauour worke all things, making vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the ſchoole of wiſedome, if ſhee gaue tolleration to
<pb facs="tcp:178497:73"/> one vaine opinion, and pietie it ſelfe, more eſteemed for her imitations, then for its owne goodneſſe; but in the ende, what with the multitudes of her owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing, and the ſlippetineſſe of the throne wherein <hi>Incertaintie</hi> had plaſt her, the Princeſſe might beholde that great minion vnto <hi>Fat,</hi> and <hi>Fauour</hi> fal like a ſtarre from the heauens, vnto the foote of the loweſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the whileſt her owne creatures, like ayme-crier; behelde her miſchaunce with nothing but lippe-pitie.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many ſuch like viſions the Princeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde in my proſpectiue, which drawing her minde to reckon with many wonders, and intangling it in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-wayed Laborinth, ſhe in the ende beſought mee to explaine the meaning of theſe doubtfull and obſcure inigmas: But ſcarce were her intreaties paſt from her lippes, when a heauie and dead ſlumber ceazing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all my ſenſes, lockt vp both my vtterance &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſo that falling into a moſt ſound ſleepe, I gaue her aſſurance, that her doubts at that time were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnſatisfied; but the Princeſſe as greedie of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as my bodie was of reſt, with pretty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the rayſing vp of her well tuned voyce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a higher Key, ſought to awake and breake off my ſleeping, till the Nymph <hi>Ethera</hi> beſought her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſatisfyed, in as much as no ſound had power to vncharme thoſe ſlumbers, declaring therewithall howe ſhee had to this ende mixt that potion of which the olde man had drunke, againſt whoſe operation there was neither noyſe, nor violence coulde preuaile: which aſſoone as the Princeſſe vnderſtoode, fearing that her feares would bee too long lyued, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſtratagem, was deuiſed onely to lend eternitie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:178497:73"/> to her doubts full of diuine impatience, cloathed in the robes of the moſt lonelyeſt anger, ſhee began bitterly to inueigh againſt the Nymph, renuing all her former opinions touching her falſhoode, and fortifying them with this witneſſe, that gaue aſſured teſtimonie, ſhee durſt not abide the triall of any innocent or vpright <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:</hi> after the Nymph had giuen the Princes leaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to tire her anger with her owne pasſion, ſhee in the end interrupted her with theſe words.</p>
            <p>See, ſee, madam (ſaid ſhee) how in the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things, this furie which we call conceyte, doth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize and confound all thoſe celeſtiall ornaments which ſhould make them moſt admyred: thinks your Maieſtie I inuented this to keepe mine owne ſinne hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? no, it is to make my glorie like the Sunne, much brighter; I know (Madam) the effects of our Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine beliefe, and the ſoueraigntie of <hi>Loue,</hi> both which admit no credite, no not to Angels, if their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges runne in oppoſitions with our fancies, wherefore (Madam) that this vertuous olde man, ſhal not like the Troyan Propheteſſe, tell truth without credite, nor I without cauſe beare the burden of calumniation; thus if it pleaſe you I haue deuiſed: the growne and hoode which this reuerent Prieſt to our great God weareth, you ſhall put on: his Booke, his beades, his Glaſſe, and his Staffe, you ſhal alſo exerciſe, and in all aprearance to the eye, bearing the whole image of his grauitie, you ſhall ſeate your ſelfe in this place, and as not beeing what you are, but what you ſeeme to bee, I meane the aged <hi>Eugenio,</hi> you ſhall this day to all ſuch as ſhall make hither their repaire for counſaile, vnfolde the hidden miſteries of their fortunes: amongeſt whom, if
<pb facs="tcp:178497:74"/> the noble Shepheard <hi>Diataſſan</hi> ſhall appeare, and vnto your owne eares diſcharge all and more then that little, all which I haue deliuered; bee then your ſelfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Iudge betwixt your beliefe, my wrong, and his inconſtancie. The Princeſſe apprehending her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, gaue eaſie conſent to the accompliſhment, and therewithall leading me into a priuate Arbor, where they might more conueniently diſroabe me, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that intricate worke, which how it was effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeconded, and controlled, who are deſirous to vnderſtande, muſt expect in the next volume.</p>
